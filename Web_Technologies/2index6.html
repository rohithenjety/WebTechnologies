   <p>  <span id="rohith" >Story:</span> I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have. Part Two might tie everything together and make me enjoy Part One more in retrospect, but unfortunately, I left wanting more from this one.

   <p><span id="rohith">Positive Points:</span> The "Mission: Impossible" franchise thrives on its adrenaline-charged action sequences, featuring jaw-dropping stunts and meticulously choreographed set-pieces that continually captivate audiences. Tom Cruise's dedicated performance as Ethan Hunt stands out, showcasing his charisma and commitment to executing daring stunts, adding an authentic and thrilling element to the films. The series is renowned for its gripping and suspenseful plots, weaving intricate espionage narratives filled with unexpected twists and turns that maintain viewers' intrigue. Visually, the franchise excels with impressive cinematography, sleek production designs, and stunning visuals that contribute to the immersive experience. Additionally, the iconic musical score by Lalo Schifrin enhances the movies' impact, becoming synonymous with the franchise's identity.

   <p><span id="rohith">Negative Points:</span> Despite its strengths, the "Mission: Impossible" series faces criticism for its occasionally convoluted and complex plotlines, making it challenging for some viewers to follow the intricacies of the narratives. Another drawback lies in the limited character development, particularly for supporting roles, as the focus often prioritizes action over deeper character arcs. The franchise is not immune to predictability, with certain story elements occasionally falling into well-worn espionage movie tropes, leading to anticipated outcomes that may diminish the surprise factor for audiences. Furthermore, while minor, continuity issues throughout the series occasionally arise, distracting some ardent fans and impacting the overall cohesion of the franchise's universe.
